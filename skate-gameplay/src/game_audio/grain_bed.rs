//! The game side of the native granular rolling bed (`skate_audio::grain`, spec
//! `audio-specs/grain-player-spec.md`), on when the native runtime runs with a MixMap and the
//! install has the whole grain recordings and their vault tuning (`audio_export.grain_whole` /
//! `grain_tuning`). Without them rolling is silent and the host logs an error (2026-10-03: the
//! interim speed-band loop is gone).
//!
//! Per frame, after the MixMap tick (`native::mixmap_frame`):
//! - **Surface routing** (§1.4, one sounding truck): the wheels' majority surface → grain member
//!   ([`grain_for`], the retail AudioSurfaceMap); a change stops both players and binds the new
//!   member (pulsing SkateBoard input 0); grinding (surface 14) stops them. In the air the last
//!   member keeps playing and the MixMap's no-contact duck silences it (what retail does with the
//!   wheel material in the air is UNCERTAIN, spec §2.10).
//! - **Records** (§2.2): position A from the member's Bézier of speed (push-scaled), B 0.1 behind;
//!   gains from SkateBoard level(1)/(2), pitch from pitch(3); the push speed-scale envelope, the
//!   brake slew, the turn intensity (`sub_824C8588`: |COM v|·0.24 capped × the turn input, slewed),
//!   the manual / trick latches ("special": A × special gain, no turn layer), the downhill level D
//!   (`sub_824CA738`, owner inputs 2/3) and wheel 0's seam-pattern gain envelope (`sub_824CA448`).
//!   Player B is the turning / downhill layer. The turn and brake slews step once per console
//!   frame (`Bed::slew_calls`, the MixMap cadence's evaluations; 2026-10-03), as retail's per-call
//!   steps on the ~30 fps console.
//! - **Soft wheels** (`sub_824C8370`): the soft member of surfaces 1..6 while the board's wheel
//!   hardness is below 0.5 (audio state `+684` = Motion+200 < 0.5); metal has only a hard member.
//! - **Chains** (§3.2, `skate_audio::grain::chain`): high-/low-pass from level(12)/(11), pan from
//!   raw(0), the FrequencyShiftSsb values (the +150 Hz special shift, the push shift envelope, the
//!   slope terms), the graph-1 level ramp and gain wobbles, the graph-3 send by speed, the env send
//!   level(13) and the FlangeSub send level(21)/(22) (carried, not rendered).
//! - **Rocket** (§2.8): `x_jet_rolling` above the owner's start speed (35 km/h), into the default bus.
//! - **Routing:** with the native rolling layers (`PlayerAudio::rolling_on`) the owner's two-truck
//!   surface routing (`player::rolling`, `sub_824C5CA8`) decides the binds and stops ([`GrainEvent`]s)
//!   and writes SkateBoard inputs 0 / 6; otherwise the bed routes one truck itself (as before).
//! - **The NPC skater's bed** ([`Bed::for_instance`], `npc_skaters.rs`, 2026-10-03): retail's
//!   SkateBoard update `sub_824C6BD8` and most of its process run for every Player-slot instance, so
//!   the NPC holding instance 1 gets its own bed (`Runtime::npc_grains`) on its own SkateBoard
//!   outputs, fed by its routing. The parts with a local test (`[owner+16]+72`) stay the local
//!   player's: the seam-pattern gain envelope (`sub_824CA448`), the graph-1 → graph-3 send and level
//!   ramp (`sub_824CAEC0`), the gain wobbles (`sub_824CB180`), graph 3 itself (`sub_824C8878`), the
//!   graph-2 FlangeSub sends (level(21) / (22), `sub_824C9058`) and the rocket (SenseOfSpeed).
